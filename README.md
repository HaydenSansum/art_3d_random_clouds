# Art 3d Random Clouds

Writing some basic data creation code to randomly produce point clouds in 3 dimensions. The idea is to create some interesting shapes and colours to then practice developing vega-lite visualisations.

Within this repository is a jupyter notebook with experimentations and then a final python script which, when run, will create and store the data in this repository.
